# ✨ Question 1 — The Fire of Accountability  

The military base has partnered with a private company to destroy its confidential paper waste through burning.  
But in the shadows, ShadowNet *(the phantom adversary — symbol of risk born from neglect)* waits, ready to exploit any gap in accountability.  

To prevent such risks, which formal proof should the government provide to confirm that the destruction truly happened?

## 📝 Options (Voices of the Team)

🇩🇰 **Mr. Eks2 – The Curious Whisper**:  
“Maybe it’s just an **inventory list** of what was supposed to be destroyed?”  

🇪🇸 **Sofia Zaymera – The Calm Guardian**:  
“Or could it be an **audit trail**, showing every action step by step?”  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
“No, it should be a proper **certificate of destruction**, giving everyone peace of mind that nothing sensitive survives.”  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
“What about a **sanitization certificate**? Isn’t that proof too?”

## ✅ Correct Answer: Certificate of Destruction  

### 💬 Team Discussion  

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
“The certificate of destruction is more than paper — it’s symbolic closure.  
It confirms sensitive data was not only touched by fire, but also erased from the realm of risk.”  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
“Exactly. An **inventory list** only shows intention, not action.  
An **audit trail** is process documentation, not final proof.  
And a **sanitization certificate** applies to wiping digital media, not burning paper.”  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
“Without that certificate, **ShadowNet** could whisper doubts, leaving blind spots in accountability.  
But with it, risk fades into silence.”

🌟 **Lesson**:  
A **Certificate of Destruction** is the official proof of accountability.  
It doesn’t just mark the act — it seals trust, compliance, and closure.
